## SOCKET_RWGROUP
# by default, the socket created by the milter has permissions
# clamav:clamav:755. SOCKET_RWGROUP changes the group and changes the
# permissions to 775 to give read-write access to that group.
#
# If you are using postfix to speak to the milter, you have to give permission
# to the postfix group to write
